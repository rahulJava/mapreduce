Execution Instructions

a) First copy all the three files roadnot and cagedbird.txt daffodils.tx  to Cloudera VM from local disk

Hadoop fs -put roadnot.txt /user/rratra1/input
Hadoop fs -put daffodils.txt /user/rratra1/input
Hadoop fs -put cagedbird.txt /user/rratra1/input
=====================================================================================================================================================

b) Run the jar file created for inverted index

We have created Jar file for following Java classes
Index.java->Index.jar		---> this code will create a reducer output containing term and their corresponding document list
FullIndex.java->FullIndex.jar. ----> This code will create a reducer output containing term their document list and offset.
BiWordIndex.java->BiWord.jar. ----> This code will produce a bi word index and their corresponding document list.
FullIndexWithSnippet.java->FullIndexWithSnippet.jar-->This code will create a reducer output which will have term their document list , offset and along with that snippet of the term.
This reducer output will be used for querying full index where in we require the snippet of the word along with document list and offset.

For MapReduce Execution 
The first argument will be the location where we have placed our input files in HDFS.
The second argument will be our output file location where we want our reducer output to be placed.

Hadoop jar /home/cloudera/Index.jar /user/rratra1/input /user/rratra1/output_index

Run the jar for full inverted index 

Hadoop jar /home/cloudera/FullIndex.jar /user/rratra1/input /user/rratra1/output_fullindex

Run the jar for full inverted index with snippet of the term

Hadoop jar /home/cloudera/FullIndexWithSnippet.jar /user/rratra1/input /user/rratra1/output_fullindexwithesnippet

Run the jar for byword indexing 

Hadoop jar /home/cloudera/BiWord.jar  /user/rratra1/input /user/rratra1/output_biword

So by now we have 4 reducer output first one contains the simple inverted index ,second one contains full inverted index with term offset and document list 
The third reducer output contains full inverted index along with snippet of the term. The fourth output contains the BiWord reducer output.
===================================================================================================================================================

c) To save the output of the reducer to a text file

Hadoop fs -cat /user/rratra1/output/p* > index_all.txt
Hadoop fs -cat /user/rratra1/output_fullindex/p* > fullindex_all.txt

======================================================================================================================================================
d)Now run the query on reducer output

We have created 3 Query Jars as follows
QueryIndex.java ->QueryIndex.jar
QueryFullIndex.java-> QueryFullIndex.jar
BiWord.java->BiWordQuery.jar


Create  a text file and insert few words in that file that needs to be queried .This will be our query file as 
we are going to give input to the query through this file.

There will be two different files for query , one will be for inverted and full inverted and the other will be for
Biword index.

The command for running query is
hadoop jar /home/cloudera/QueryIndex.jar  /home/cloudera/test.txt /user/rratra1/output_index test_output.txt
adoop jar /home/cloudera/QQueryFullIndex.jar  /home/cloudera/test.txt /user/rratra1/output_fullindexwithsnippet test_output.txt
adoop jar /home/cloudera/BiWordQuery.jar /home/cloudera/test.txt /user/rratra1/output_biword test_output.txt

Where in the first argument is location of the query file , the second argument
Is the location of our reducer output and the third argument is the place where we want to save the result of the query.
